    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hey, I'm a passionate roblox developer and I focus on refactoring games and GUI - wether that'd be redesigning and recoding GUI objects, or designing ones from the ground up. Other than that, I also do LUA Scripting. In my time as a Roblox Developer, I have contributed to over 900K Visits across different games I did work on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm constantly exploring new methods, looks and design to always give users the "woah" feeling when they interact with the game. I have worked on multiple projects, and everyone i've worked with have appreciated the work I delivered, and I do both commisions and employment. If the project isn't very big, I don't require payment, as it is simply free learning for. (though for bigger projects pay is needed for my time)
    </p>
    <p>
      As mentioned, I mainly focus on refactoring (modernizing) games. Most of my work is done on Roleplay Games, and mostly those who include free models that gives errors, puts a large load on the players' systems and ultimately causes the game to lag and be heavy (spoiler: it doesnt need to be!)

    <h2>What I do</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned, i've contributed to a large amount of place visits, and also done work on games that are unreleased. My work is mostly done on smaller communities, but I also work on bigger projects here and then.
    </p>
    <p>
    Refactoring: What I focus on is refactoring of games. This is the process where the game is "modernized" and optimized to have better performance, a modern look and better functtionality. I have about 2 years of experience in this field, and I also do some basic building and scripting.
